# Fine-Tuning Open-Source Language Models for 11+ Verbal Reasoning: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction  
Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model can empower it to **generate and solve grammar school-level verbal reasoning questions** similar to an 11+ entrance exam. In this guide, we will cover how to select a suitable open-source model (around 7–13B parameters) with strong reasoning ability, prepare a fine-tuning dataset from sample questions, and perform efficient fine-tuning (using **QLoRA/LoRA** or full training). We’ll also discuss the **infrastructure setup on AWS**, including instance recommendations, environment preparation, and training time estimates. By the end, you should be equipped to train a model that can both pose new verbal reasoning questions and provide correct answers, suitable for production deployment.

## Selecting a Base Model for Reasoning  
Choosing the right pre-trained model is critical. We want a model that has been trained on *rich English text and knowledge*, including content that fosters **reasoning, logic, and academic language understanding**. Below are some open-source candidates (≈7–13B parameters) known for strong reasoning or educational content in their pretraining:

- **Meta LLaMA 2 – 13B** – A high-quality foundational model trained on 2 trillion tokens of text (≈90% English) ([An Overview of Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models | by Pradeep Goel | Medium](https://medium.com/@pradeepgoel/an-overview-of-llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models-955677da69a6#:~:text=match%20at%20L208%20English%20language,in%20English%20language%20use%20cases)), drawn from diverse sources like **Common Crawl, books, Wikipedia, academic papers, and StackExchange Q&A** ([RedPajama: an Open Dataset for Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.12372v1#:~:text=LLaMa%20technical%20report%C2%A0,paragraph%29%20description)). LLaMA 2 has strong general reasoning abilities and scored well on knowledge benchmarks. It’s available in both a base version and a Chat-finetuned version. *Recommendation:* Use the base model for fine-tuning (or the Chat version if you want an instruct-ready starting point). (Hugging Face: [`meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf`](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf)).

- **Microsoft Orca – 13B** – Based on LLaMA 2, Orca was **fine-tuned with rich explanations from GPT-4**, teaching the model to emulate the reasoning process of a larger model. This approach dramatically boosts its zero-shot reasoning performance – *Orca 2 (13B) outperforms LLaMA 2 Chat 13B by ~47% on complex reasoning tasks* ([Orca 2: Enhancing Reasoning in Smaller Language Models - Evaluation Results | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/orca-2-enhancing-reasoning-in-smaller-language-models-evaluation-results#:~:text=Orca%202%20significantly%20outperforms%20models,efficacy%20of%20the%20training%20process)). Orca is an excellent choice when reasoning and following instructions are paramount. (Hugging Face: [`microsoft/Orca-2-13b`](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Orca-2-13b)).

- **Google Flan-T5 XXL – 11B** – An encoder–decoder model (T5 architecture) that has been **instruction-tuned on 1,836 diverse tasks** (the Flan 2022 collection). These tasks include *language understanding, logic puzzles, mathematics, and Big Bench Hard (BBH) challenges*. This broad fine-tuning gives Flan-T5 strong zero-shot reasoning skills – for example, Flan-T5 11B significantly outperforms the original T5 on challenging BIG-Bench reasoning tasks ([[PDF] Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Flan,Bench%20tasks%20%28)). It was also tuned with *chain-of-thought* prompts to enhance multi-step reasoning ([Papers Explained 75: Flan T5, Flan PaLM | by Ritvik Rastogi | Medium](https://ritvik19.medium.com/papers-explained-75-flan-t5-flan-palm-caf168b6f76#:~:text=CoT%20prompting%20abilities%20of%20Flan)). Flan-T5 is a good option for QA-style fine-tuning and is fully open-source. (Hugging Face: [`google/flan-t5-xxl`](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl)).

- **AI2 OLMo 2 – 13B** – A new open model from Allen Institute, trained on *5 trillion tokens* of the **Dolma** dataset (a diverse, high-quality corpus). OLMo-2 models are **competitive with LLaMA-class models on English academic benchmarks** ([OLMo 2: The best fully open language model to date  | Ai2](https://allenai.org/blog/olmo2#:~:text=tokens,1%20on%20English%20academic%20benchmarks)). In particular, the 13B model excels at knowledge recall, commonsense reasoning, and math/logic tasks due to careful training curriculum. AI2 provides an **Instruct-tuned** variant (OLMo-2-13B-Instruct) which is already aligned to follow prompts. This model is fully open (Apache license) and optimized for English academic and reasoning tasks. (Hugging Face: [`allenai/OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct)).

- **EleutherAI Pythia – 6.9B/12B** – A suite of GPT-style models trained on **The Pile**, a 800GB dataset including diverse web text, books, academic papers (ArXiv), Stack Exchange Q&As, and even math problems ([[2101.00027] The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2101.00027#:~:text=an%20anonymized%20set%20of%20all,downstream%20models%20on%20diverse%20domains)) ([[2101.00027] The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2101.00027#:~:text=2)). This means Pythia has seen a broad range of knowledge and *question-answer formats* during pretraining. While the architecture is slightly older and smaller, a Pythia-12B model still handles English reasoning fairly well and is 100% open. Fine-tuning would be needed to teach it the specific verbal reasoning formats. (Hugging Face: [`EleutherAI/pythia-12b`](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-12b)). 

Each of the above models is **compatible with parameter-efficient fine-tuning** (LoRA/QLoRA), which is important given their size. LLaMA 2 and its derivatives (Orca, etc.) require accepting the model license (allowing commercial use with some restrictions), while others like Flan-T5, OLMo, and Pythia are fully Apache-2.0 or similar. For our purpose – *an English-only verbal reasoning tutor* – models like LLaMA 2 or Orca (for raw reasoning power) and Flan-T5 or OLMo (for strong instruction-following on academic tasks) would be top choices.

> **Note:** It’s possible to start with an *instruction-tuned* model (like LLaMA 2-Chat or OLMo-Instruct) to benefit from its conversational alignment, then further fine-tune it on your domain Q&A. This often speeds up convergence. However, even a base model will learn the format given a good fine-tuning dataset.

## Preparing the Verbal Reasoning Dataset  
To fine-tune the model, we need to create a dataset of **prompt–response pairs** that capture the verbal reasoning tasks. Each pair will typically consist of a **question (or instruction)** and a **desired answer (or completion)**. Here’s how to format the data, using examples from the Stockport Grammar 11+ sample paper:

- **Include the full context of the question in the prompt.** Many 11+ questions are self-contained (e.g. word puzzles, sequences) but some refer to a shared passage or setup. Make sure the model sees whatever text a student sees before answering. For instance, a logic puzzle with a story should have that story in the prompt.

- **Ask the question clearly, and if needed, indicate the answer format.** The model should know *what it’s expected to output*. If a question asks for “which letter…”, you want the model to output a single letter; if it asks “underline the two words…”, the model should output those two words, etc. In the dataset, you can phrase the prompt to remind the model of the task. For example, prepend something like **“Question:”** before the puzzle and **“Answer:”** before the solution in training, to reinforce the format.

- **One question per sample.** Even if the exam sheet lists several under one instruction, it’s simplest to break them out. This gives you more training pairs and fine-grained control. (The exception is if a single question naturally expects multiple answers or a list.)

Below are **two examples** of how to format questions and answers from the sample paper into a JSON or text format for fine-tuning:

1. *Word Fragment Puzzle* – The exam asks: *“Which ONE letter ends all the words in each question?”* and gives fragments like `ris-`, `bar-`, `bloc-`, `plan-`. We format this as:  
   ```json
   {
     "instruction": "Find the single letter that can be added to each of these fragments to form a word: \"ris-\", \"bar-\", \"bloc-\", \"plan-\". Which one letter ends all the words?",
     "output": "K"
   }
   ```  
   **Explanation:** Here the `instruction` includes a clear directive and the fragments. The correct answer letter **K** (forming *risk, bark, block, plank*) is given as the `output`. We explicitly phrased “Which one letter ends all the words?” to mimic the exam’s question style and ensure the model knows it’s looking for one letter.

2. *Logic Puzzle (Lunch Choices)* – The exam provides a scenario and then asks specific questions:  

   *Passage:* “David invited three friends (Ranjit, Jennifer, Bradley) to his birthday. They each chose a different lunch (hot dog, pizza, burger) and each brought a different present (book, model, pyjamas). Ranjit did not order pizza but he brought a book. Jennifer had a hot dog. Bradley brought a model.”  
   *Question:* “Who had pizza for lunch?”  

   For fine-tuning, we combine the passage and question into the prompt, and provide the answer:  
   ```json
   {
     "instruction": "David invited three friends (Ranjit, Jennifer, Bradley) to his party. Each friend chose a different lunch (hot dog, pizza, or burger) and brought a different present (book, model, or pyjamas). We know:\n- Ranjit did not order pizza and he brought a book.\n- Jennifer had a hot dog.\n- Bradley brought a model.\nQuestion: Who had pizza for lunch?",
     "output": "Bradley"
   }
   ```  
   **Explanation:** The `instruction` includes all the clues as bullet points (for clarity) and then asks the question. The answer `"Bradley"` is the correct solution (since Bradley is the only one left who could have had pizza). You would similarly format the other sub-questions (e.g., “Who gave David pyjamas?” etc.) reusing the same passage in the prompt each time. This trains the model to refer to the given context when answering.

- **Consistent formatting:** It’s wise to adopt a consistent style across the dataset. For instance, always start the prompt with either a brief description or directly the question, and perhaps use delimiters like `Question:` and `Answer:` as shown. Consistency helps the model learn the pattern of turning a prompt into the correct answer.

- **Cover various question types:** Ensure your fine-tuning data includes **all the types** of verbal reasoning problems you care about:
  - Word analogies or synonyms (e.g., choosing two words closest in meaning).
  - Odd-one-out in a list.
  - Antonyms pairs.
  - Jumbled letters forming words.
  - Letter codes and ciphers (as seen in the sample).
  - Sequence puzzles (letters or numbers).
  - Logic grids (assigning people to things based on clues).
  - Hidden words and pattern finding (e.g., hidden word in a sentence).
  
  Each type might require the model to adopt a slightly different strategy, so including examples of each in the fine-tuning set will give the model a chance to learn them. If the sample paper is your only source, you might augment it with similar questions from other past papers or create additional ones to have multiple examples of each type.

- **No ambiguity in answers:** Since this model will be used to *generate answers on its own*, the fine-tuning examples should ideally have **unambiguous answers**. If a question could have multiple correct answers, specify how to choose one. (For example, if instructing the model to “underline the two words… closest in meaning,” the output should list those two words, and only those.)

Once your dataset is prepared, you can save it in a JSONL format (one JSON object per line) or as a CSV with columns like `instruction, output`. Many training scripts (Hugging Face `datasets` or custom DataCollators) can read these formats easily.

## Fine-Tuning Methods: QLoRA, LoRA, and Full Training  

With a dataset ready, the next step is to fine-tune the model. Fine-tuning large models from scratch (updating all 13B parameters) can be extremely resource-intensive. Instead, we will focus on **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** via **LoRA** and **QLoRA**, which drastically reduce hardware requirements by training only small adapter layers on top of the base model. We’ll also note how you could do a full fine-tune if needed.

### 1. Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) – Preferred Approach  
**QLoRA** combines two techniques: model *quantization* and LoRA adapters ([Fine-Tune Gemma using Hugging Face Transformers and QloRA  |  Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_finetune_qlora#:~:text=performance,kept%20as%20a%20separate%20adapter)). In QLoRA, we **freeze the original model weights** and **load them in 4-bit precision**, which slashes memory usage. We then attach small trainable LoRA layers to the model and train those. This allows us to fine-tune a 13B model on a **single GPU** (even a 16–24 GB GPU) without out-of-memory errors, while achieving nearly full fine-tune quality ([Fine-Tune Gemma using Hugging Face Transformers and QloRA  |  Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_finetune_qlora#:~:text=performance,kept%20as%20a%20separate%20adapter)).

**How QLoRA works:** The model’s weights are stored in 4-bit (int4) precision (using an innovative data type called **NF4** for minimal loss). During training, those 4-bit weights are *dequantized on the fly* to higher precision for computation, but gradients are only applied to the LoRA adapter weights (which are full 16-bit) ([LoRA and QLoRA- Effective methods to Fine-tune your LLMs in detail. | by Levin M S | Medium](https://medium.com/@levxn/lora-and-qlora-effective-methods-to-fine-tune-your-llms-in-detail-6e56a2a13f3c#:~:text=Working%20of%20QLoRA%3A)) ([LoRA and QLoRA- Effective methods to Fine-tune your LLMs in detail. | by Levin M S | Medium](https://medium.com/@levxn/lora-and-qlora-effective-methods-to-fine-tune-your-llms-in-detail-6e56a2a13f3c#:~:text=%28LORA%29%20in%2032,computation%20data%20type%20to%20perform)). The original weights stay fixed. The LoRA adapters learn the task-specific changes. After training, you can *optionally merge* the LoRA layers into the base model weights (converting back to 16-bit) or keep them separate and just load them alongside the base model at inference.

**Setup:** We will use Hugging Face Transformers and the PEFT library to implement QLoRA. The high-level steps:

- **Install required libraries** on your training machine (if not already available):
  ```bash
  pip install transformers==4.33.0 accelerate peft datasets bitsandbytes
  ```
  (Use a versions that support LLaMA and QLoRA; as of 2024, HF Transformers 4.33+ and PEFT 0.5+ are ideal. The `bitsandbytes` library enables 4-bit loading.)

- **Load the pre-trained model in 4-bit mode.** Use `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` with a `BitsAndBytesConfig`. For example:  
  ```python
  import torch
  from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig

  model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf"  # or other chosen model
  quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True,
                                    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,  # use 16-bit for compute
                                    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,  # use double quantization for memory save
                                    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4")      # NormalFloat4 quantization
  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, quantization_config=quant_config, device_map="auto")
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
  ```  
  This will download and load the 13B model in 4-bit precision across the available GPU(s) (using `device_map="auto"` to split if necessary). The tokenizer is needed to prepare text data.

- **Attach LoRA adapters** to the model. We specify which layers to target (typically the query/key or value projection matrices in each transformer block) and the LoRA hyperparameters (rank `r` and alpha scaling). For example:  
  ```python
  from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

  lora_config = LoraConfig(
      r=16,             # rank of LoRA decomposition
      lora_alpha=32,    # scaling factor
      lora_dropout=0.05,# dropout on LoRA (reduce overfitting)
      bias="none",      # don't add extra biases
      task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
      target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"]  # which parts of the model to apply LoRA to (for LLaMA architecture)
  )
  model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
  model.print_trainable_parameters()
  ```  
  The `print_trainable_parameters()` should show a small fraction of total parameters (e.g. **0.1%** of 13B, on the order of millions of params) are trainable – confirming that only the LoRA layers will update. *In QLoRA, the base model’s 4-bit weights remain frozen ([Fine-Tune Gemma using Hugging Face Transformers and QloRA  |  Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_finetune_qlora#:~:text=performance,kept%20as%20a%20separate%20adapter)).* 

- **Prepare the dataset for training.** You can load your dataset (e.g. from a JSONL file) using `datasets.load_dataset`. Ensure the data is tokenized and formatted as model input. A convenient approach is to concatenate the `instruction` and `output` with a separator. For example, for each sample, you might create a string:  
  ```python
  prompt_text = sample["instruction"].strip()
  answer_text = sample["output"].strip()
  # Combine with a separator token or pattern
  input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text + "\nAnswer: ", return_tensors='pt').input_ids
  labels_ids = tokenizer(answer_text, return_tensors='pt').input_ids
  ```  
  For causal LM fine-tuning, we often concatenate prompt and answer and use a special token or newline to separate them. The `labels` should be such that the model is only penalized for predicting the answer part (and possibly the newline). In practice, you can set the prompt tokens’ labels to -100 to ignore them in loss, and only have the answer tokens as labels. Hugging Face’s `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` or a custom collator can handle this.

- **Training loop with Hugging Face Trainer (or TRL’s SFTTrainer).** We can use the regular `Trainer` API for supervised fine-tuning:
  ```python
  from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

  training_args = TrainingArguments(
      output_dir="finetune-verbal-reasoning-lora",
      per_device_train_batch_size=2,
      gradient_accumulation_steps=16,  # effective batch size = 32
      num_train_epochs=3,
      learning_rate=2e-4,
      fp16=True,  # use mixed precision for speed
      logging_steps=50,
      evaluation_strategy="no"
  )
  trainer = Trainer(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, args=training_args,
                    train_dataset=train_dataset, 
                    data_collator=my_data_collator)  # ensure collator sets labels appropriately
  trainer.train()
  ```  
  In the above, we use a relatively high learning rate (LoRA often can use ~2e-4 to 1e-3). We accumulate gradients to simulate a larger batch (because batch size per GPU may be limited in 4-bit mode). We also enable FP16 training (the LoRA params are float16 by default). You can adjust `num_train_epochs` depending on dataset size – e.g., for a few thousand samples, 2–3 epochs is usually enough; monitor loss to avoid overfitting since these puzzles have deterministic answers.

  Alternatively, you can use the **TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) library’s `SFTTrainer`**, which has built-in support for PEFT. This can simplify some of the above. According to TRL documentation: *“The SFTTrainer supports a native integration with PEFT, making it straightforward to efficiently tune LLMs using QLoRA – you just provide a `LoraConfig` to the trainer.”* ([Fine-Tune Gemma using Hugging Face Transformers and QloRA  |  Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_finetune_qlora#:~:text=The%20,provide%20it%20to%20the%20trainer)) ([Fine-Tune Gemma using Hugging Face Transformers and QloRA  |  Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_finetune_qlora#:~:text=You%20now%20have%20every%20building,the%20training%20of%20your%20model)). Either approach will yield the same result; use whichever you find more convenient.

- **Save the LoRA weights.** After training, you’ll have a set of learned adapter weights (usually only a few MBs). You can save them with `trainer.save_model()` (which will save the Peft model by default). If you want to **merge the LoRA into the base model** (creating a standalone 13B model with updated weights), you can do:  
  ```python
  model = model.merge_and_unload()  # merges LoRA weights into the base model
  model.save_pretrained("finetuned-model-full-weights")
  ```  
  Keep in mind merging will produce large weight files (on the order of gigabytes) and you’ll likely want to convert them to half precision (FP16) or 8-bit for deployment to save memory. You can also skip merging and simply load the base model + LoRA adapter for inference.

**Why QLoRA?** Using QLoRA, recent research was able to fine-tune models as large as 65B on a single GPU with minimal performance loss ([Fine-Tune Gemma using Hugging Face Transformers and QloRA  |  Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_finetune_qlora#:~:text=performance,kept%20as%20a%20separate%20adapter)). It’s an ideal method here because our dataset is relatively small (so we don’t need to update all weights) and we want to minimize cost. The 4-bit quantization does not significantly hurt the final accuracy of the model on the fine-tuned task, especially since the model’s knowledge is largely intact and we’re only adjusting it with LoRA.

### 2. LoRA (without Quantization) – Alternative  
If you have slightly more memory available or prefer not to quantize, you can fine-tune using **LoRA on the full model in 16-bit or 8-bit**. The steps are very similar to QLoRA, except:

- Load the model in 16-bit (default) or 8-bit (using `load_in_8bit=True` with bitsandbytes) instead of 4-bit. This will require more GPU RAM. For a 13B model:
  - 16-bit requires ~26 GB just for the model weights.
  - 8-bit int8 requires roughly half that (~13 GB) plus some overhead. So a 16 GB GPU can often handle a 13B in 8-bit. You would do:
    ```python
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, 
                load_in_8bit=True, device_map="auto")
    ```
    and then attach LoRA as before.

- Everything else (defining LoRA config, training loop) is the same as described above. You still freeze the base weights; you’re just not compressing them as much during training. **LoRA** by itself greatly reduces the number of trainable parameters (to <1% of the model) but does not reduce memory *unless* you also use 8-bit or 4-bit loading for the base model.

In practice, if your GPU has 24 GB or more, you might load the model in 16-bit and do LoRA. If it has ~16 GB, 8-bit loading is a good middle-ground (e.g., using `bitsandbytes` int8). The fine-tuning quality should be similar to QLoRA. QLoRA might be slightly slower per step due to dequantization overhead, but it enables using even smaller GPUs. 

**Training hyperparameters** for LoRA are generally the same as QLoRA. You might even try a slightly higher learning rate if using a fully higher-precision base. Always monitor the loss and try a short run on a subset to ensure things are in order.

### 3. Full Model Fine-Tuning (Supervised Fine-Tuning without adapters) – Optional  
For completeness, you *could* fine-tune the entire model on these tasks, though this is usually not necessary and is computationally expensive. Full fine-tuning might be considered if you suspect the model needs significant adjustment (which is unlikely for 11+ English tasks, given these models’ pretraining).

**Considerations for full SFT:**
- **Hardware:** Fine-tuning all 13B parameters with backprop requires a lot of GPU memory or multiple GPUs. For example, in FP16 you’d need ~2×32GB GPUs (or one 80GB A100) to fit the model and gradients. Techniques like gradient checkpointing can reduce memory at the cost of speed. Alternatively, using DeepSpeed or PyTorch `FSDP` to shard the model across GPUs can make it feasible on smaller GPUs, but that’s complex to set up for a beginner.
- **Training time:** Updating all parameters can converge faster in terms of steps (since the model has more freedom to adjust), but each step is slower and you have more parameters to store. Checkpoint size will be huge (multi-GB) and iteration will be slower than LoRA on the same hardware.

If you do want to attempt full fine-tuning, you would largely follow the same data preparation and Trainer setup, but *do not use PEFT*. Instead, load the model normally (in 16-bit or bfloat16 if using newer GPUs), and call `Trainer.train()`. You may want to use a lower learning rate (e.g. 1e-5 to 5e-5) for stability, since updating all weights can more easily wreck the model’s pretraining knowledge if too aggressive. Also consider *gradual unfreezing* or smaller learning rate on lower layers, though this is advanced tuning.

**In summary**, for this task **QLoRA is recommended** because it’s efficient and has proven success on similar instruction-tuning problems (e.g., the original QLoRA paper fine-tuned models on QA datasets and got strong results with minimal resources). LoRA without quant is a solid alternative if you have the VRAM headroom. Full fine-tuning is usually not worth the cost here, as it offers only marginal gains, if any, over LoRA for an already well-pretrained model.

## Infrastructure Requirements and AWS Setup  

Fine-tuning a 7–13B model is very achievable on modern cloud GPUs. Here we detail the recommended setup on **AWS**, including instance types, environment preparation, and expected training times.

### **Choosing an AWS Instance (GPU Hardware)**  
For QLoRA or LoRA fine-tuning, you’ll need a **GPU with at least 16 GB of VRAM** (for a 13B model). Here are some suitable AWS instance options:

- **g5.xlarge (1× NVIDIA A10G)** – This instance has one A10G GPU with 24 GB VRAM, which is excellent for our use. A10G offers similar performance to an RTX A6000. With 24 GB, you can easily fine-tune a 13B with QLoRA (using ~6–8 GB for model and the rest for overhead) or even in 16-bit LoRA if needed. The g5 family also provides modern CPUs which help with data loading. *(This is a recommended choice for cost-efficiency.)*

- **g4dn.xlarge (1× NVIDIA T4)** – T4 GPU with 16 GB VRAM. This can work *at the limit* for QLoRA on 13B. It’s likely sufficient if you use 4-bit quantization and a small batch size. Training will be slower due to older GPU architecture (Turing) and lower memory bandwidth, but it’s the most budget-friendly. If using T4, definitely use QLoRA (4-bit) and perhaps gradient accumulate more steps to keep memory usage low. Expect training to be slower than on A10 or V100/A100.

- **p3.2xlarge (1× NVIDIA V100)** – V100 GPU with 16 GB VRAM. Performance is better than T4, roughly on par or slightly below A10G. 16 GB is still a bit tight for 13B in 16-bit, so use 8-bit or 4-bit modes. p3 instances are older but very reliable. If you already use AWS Deep Learning AMI, this is a common choice. (p3.8xlarge and up have multiple V100s if you want multi-GPU.)

- **p4d.24xlarge (8× NVIDIA A100 40GB)** – This is a high-end option with eight A100 GPUs (40 GB each) and high-speed interconnect. This is overkill for QLoRA (you’d only need one GPU out of eight). However, if you wanted to do full fine-tuning or experiment with a larger model (30B+), A100s are ideal. AWS now also offers **p4de** and **p5** instances with A100 80GB and H100 respectively, which are top-of-the-line. For our 13B case, you won’t need this power unless you want to dramatically speed up training by using data parallelism across multiple GPUs.

**Storage:** Ensure you allocate enough disk space for model weights and checkpoints. A 13B model in 4-bit is ~6–7 GB, in 16-bit around 26 GB. Plan for at least 30–50 GB of space. If using an **AWS Deep Learning AMI**, you can attach an EBS volume of 50 GB (gp3) and that should be sufficient for the dataset and output. If using Spot instances, consider storing your dataset and output on S3 so you can reattach if needed.

### **Environment Setup**  
Once you have your instance:

- **Activate a Python environment** with the required libraries. If using the AWS Deep Learning AMI, you might do:
  ```bash
  conda activate pytorch_p39  # for example, activate PyTorch environment
  ```
  and then `pip install` the libraries as mentioned earlier (Transformers, PEFT, etc.). Ensure your `transformers` version supports the model you chose (for LLaMA or newer architectures, v4.30+ is needed, and for OLMo you might need an even later version or specific integration).

- **CUDA and drivers**: The NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit are pre-installed on the AWS DLAMI and configured for the instance’s GPU. You can verify by running `nvidia-smi`. If you use a generic AMI, you’d need to install CUDA drivers which is more complicated – thus, using AWS’s pre-made images or containers (like AWS Deep Learning Containers or Hugging Face Deep Learning containers) is recommended.

- **Data transfer**: Upload your fine-tuning dataset to the instance (or to S3). You can use SCP/SFTP to copy files, or directly integrate AWS S3 via the AWS CLI. For example:
  ```bash
  aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/verbal_reasoning_data.jsonl ./dataset.jsonl
  ```
  and similarly prepare a folder for outputs.

- **Install model weights**: The first time you run the script, Hugging Face will download the base model from their hub. This can take a while (the LLaMA2 13B is ~26GB in FP16). Make sure your instance has a good network connection (AWS instances typically have high network bandwidth, but if behind a proxy configure `hf_hub_download` accordingly). If you plan to run multiple experiments, consider using the **HF cache** (usually `~/.cache/huggingface` by default) – once the model is downloaded, it will be reused. Ensure you have space for this cache on your disk.

- **Test a small run**: Before launching a full training, it’s wise to do a short test on a subset of data to confirm everything is wired correctly. This can catch issues with tokenization or formatting that might cause shape mismatches, etc.

### **Training Time Expectations**  
Training time will depend on hardware and dataset size. Here are rough estimates:

- On a **single A10G 24GB (g5.xlarge)**: Fine-tuning ~1000 samples for 3 epochs (so 3000 training steps if batch=1) with QLoRA might take on the order of **1–2 hours**. If your dataset is larger, say 5000 samples (15k steps for 3 epochs), it could take ~4–6 hours. The A10G has performance similar to a 3080, which is quite decent. With a batch size of 2 and grad accumulation, you effectively utilize the GPU well.

- On a **single T4 16GB (g4dn)**: It will be slower – possibly 2× the A10G time or more. T4 has less compute throughput. So 3000 steps might take ~2–3 hours. Still, an overnight run can handle a few epochs on a moderate dataset.

- On a **V100 16GB (p3)**: Slightly faster than T4, perhaps 1.5× slower than A10. So maybe ~1.5–2.5 hours for 3000 steps.

- On a **A100 40GB**: If you use a single A100 out of a p4d.24xlarge (for example), training will be quite fast. A100 has much higher throughput – potentially 2× or more the speed of A10. So 3000 steps could finish in well under an hour. Using multiple A100s with data parallelism (e.g., 2 GPUs splitting the batch) can further cut wall-time roughly in half (though you get diminishing returns beyond a point due to overhead and small dataset size).

These are ballpark figures; actual time depends on sequence lengths of your data (longer inputs like the logic puzzle passages will mean more computation per sample). The sample 11+ questions are generally short (often one sentence prompt or a short paragraph at most), so sequence length isn’t huge (likely under 256 tokens for most, except maybe the long sports day puzzle). This means training steps are relatively quick.

### **Monitoring and Logging**  
While training, monitor GPU usage with `nvidia-smi` to ensure you’re utilizing the GPU (you should see ~95–100% during training steps). If using the Hugging Face Trainer, you can set `logging_steps` to get periodic loss printouts in the console. It’s a good idea to watch the loss decrease and save intermediate checkpoints (`save_steps` or `save_epochs` parameter) especially if training for many epochs, so you can pick the best model or recover from interruptions.

You might also evaluate the model on a small validation set of questions (if you have some held-out puzzles) to verify that the model is learning to produce correct answers rather than memorizing. Given the deterministic nature of these questions, simply tracking training loss might be sufficient (it should drop to near-zero when the model can consistently produce the correct answers in training).

### **Deployment Considerations**  
After fine-tuning, you will have a model that can answer verbal reasoning questions or generate new ones. For production usage:

- Decide whether to merge LoRA weights into the base model. If you do, you get a single set of weights you can load with `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`. If not, you will need to load the base model and then apply `PeftModel.from_pretrained` to add the LoRA adapter weights at inference time. Both approaches are fine; keeping LoRA separate means you always need both files, but you can also easily swap adapters or disable them if needed.

- **Model quantization for inference:** To serve the model efficiently, you can use 8-bit inference or even 4-bit inference. Libraries like `transformers` with `bitsandbytes` allow loading the model in 8-bit for inference too (similar to what we did for training). This can drastically cut memory usage on your inference server. For instance, a 13B model in 8-bit might only need ~13 GB RAM, which means it could potentially run on a GPU or even CPU with enough RAM (though CPU inference will be slow). For real-time usage, a GPU is recommended.

- **AWS deployment:** For a simple setup, you can continue using the EC2 instance you trained on to run inference. If you need an API endpoint, consider using AWS SageMaker endpoints or an EC2 with a web server. SageMaker has the advantage of managed deployment and autoscaling, but it’s a bit complex to containerize the model. An easier path might be using the Hugging Face Inference DLC (Docker) on SageMaker, which now supports deploying custom models; they have examples for deploying fine-tuned LLaMA models.

- **Testing the model:** Try prompting your fine-tuned model with various instructions to ensure it responds correctly. For example:
  - *Direct Q&A:* “**Question:** In each sentence below, a 3-letter word is hidden. *London is a ITAL city.* What is the hidden word? **Answer:**” – The model should ideally output `CAP` (from “capital”).  
  - *Generation:* “Generate a verbal reasoning question about finding a hidden word in a sentence, and then give the answer.” – The model should produce a new puzzle and solve it. Since we fine-tuned mainly on Q->A pairs, the model might not immediately know to *create* new questions unless we included such examples. However, large models often generalize patterns. If it doesn’t do it naturally, you can coerce it by example (few-shot) or do a slight further fine-tune with prompts that ask for generation. In many cases, though, having seen many Q&A, the model can invert the role and generate similar Qs if prompted accordingly.

- **Safety and validation:** Because this model will be used in an educational context, you should validate that its outputs are **accurate and appropriate**. Check a set of known questions and verify the answers. The model might occasionally make mistakes (especially on very novel puzzles or if wording is tricky). If needed, you can apply a second stage RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) or simply curate more fine-tuning data covering any failure modes (for example, if it struggled with a particular puzzle type, add more of those with correct answers). The goal is a reliable tutor model that *never gives incorrect answers to these formatted questions*, since students will trust it. Given the deterministic nature of verbal reasoning puzzles, a well-fine-tuned model should reach near 100% accuracy on the styles it has seen.

## Conclusion  
By selecting a strong base model and fine-tuning it with QLoRA on a tailored dataset, you can create a **specialized verbal reasoning Q&A model** without needing massive computational resources. We identified several candidate models with relevant pretraining (e.g. LLaMA 2 for its broad knowledge ([RedPajama: an Open Dataset for Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.12372v1#:~:text=LLaMa%20technical%20report%C2%A0,paragraph%29%20description)), Orca for its enhanced reasoning, Flan-T5 for its multi-task instruction strength, etc.), and demonstrated how to format 11+ exam questions into a machine-learnable form. Using QLoRA, we leverage 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters to efficiently train on a single GPU, which **dramatically lowers cost and time** while maintaining performance ([Fine-Tune Gemma using Hugging Face Transformers and QloRA  |  Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_finetune_qlora#:~:text=performance,kept%20as%20a%20separate%20adapter)). 

Finally, with an AWS setup using a GPU instance like g5, you can fine-tune and deploy the model. The fine-tuned model can **generate new practice questions** and **provide answers/explanations**, serving as a helpful tutor or content generator for grammar school students. By following this guide, you should be able to reproduce the process, adapt it to your specific dataset, and iteratively improve the model. Good luck with your fine-tuning, and enjoy watching your model solve (and pose) verbal reasoning puzzles like a seasoned teacher!
