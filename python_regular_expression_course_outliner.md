That makes perfect sense! Here's the structured course plan for learning regular expressions in Python:

---

### **Course: Mastering Regular Expressions in Python**
**Objective**: Take you from beginner to advanced level in Python regular expressions (`re` module), with interactive checkpoints.

#### **Module 1: Introduction to Regular Expressions**
- What are regular expressions?
- Why use regular expressions?
- The `re` module in Python
- Writing your first regex pattern

**Checkpoint:** Would you like to see more examples, or should we proceed?

---

#### **Module 2: Basic Regex Patterns**
- Matching literal characters
- Using metacharacters (`. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )`)
- Using `re.search()` and `re.match()`
- Examples and practice problems

**Checkpoint:** Do you need more examples or explanations?

---

#### **Module 3: Character Classes and Special Sequences**
- `[abc]`, `[^abc]`, `[a-zA-Z]`
- `\d`, `\D`, `\s`, `\S`, `\w`, `\W`, `\b`, `\B`
- Using `re.findall()` for extracting data
- Real-world examples (e.g., extracting numbers, words, emails)

**Checkpoint:** Are you comfortable with character classes, or would you like to explore more?

---

#### **Module 4: Anchors and Boundaries**
- `^` (start of string), `$` (end of string)
- `\b` (word boundary), `\B` (non-word boundary)
- Writing patterns for specific string positions

**Checkpoint:** Do you want more practical exercises here?

---

#### **Module 5: Quantifiers and Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching**
- `*`, `+`, `?`, `{m,n}`
- Understanding greedy vs. lazy (non-greedy) matching
- Examples with different quantifiers

**Checkpoint:** Would you like more examples or to practice with custom cases?

---

#### **Module 6: Grouping and Capturing**
- Using `()` for capturing groups
- Named groups (`(?P<name>...)`)
- Using `re.groups()` and `re.groupdict()`
- Extracting specific parts of a match

**Checkpoint:** Do you feel confident in capturing groups, or would you like more practice?

---

#### **Module 7: Lookaheads and Lookbehinds (Advanced Topic)**
- Positive lookahead `(?=...)`
- Negative lookahead `(?!...)`
- Positive lookbehind `(?<=...)`
- Negative lookbehind `(?<!...)`
- Practical use cases (e.g., matching words not followed by certain words)

**Checkpoint:** Would you like to see more advanced use cases?

---

#### **Module 8: Substitution and Splitting**
- Using `re.sub()` for replacing text
- Using `re.split()` for breaking strings
- Advanced replacement with functions

**Checkpoint:** Do you want to dive deeper into `re.sub()` with advanced examples?

---

#### **Module 9: Performance Optimization & Best Practices**
- Compiling regex patterns with `re.compile()`
- Avoiding catastrophic backtracking
- Optimizing regex for performance
- When **not** to use regex

**Checkpoint:** Are you ready for a final test and real-world exercises?

---

#### **Final Module: Real-World Applications**
- Validating emails, phone numbers, and passwords
- Extracting structured data from text
- Parsing logs and documents
- Regex for web scraping

**Final Checkpoint:** Do you feel ready to test your skills with a final project?
