## Project Overview

### 1. RAG Implementation for Educational Content Management

**Objective:** Establish a robust vector database system to store and intelligently retrieve UK school exam preparation questionnaires through a high-performance API interface.

#### **Phase 1: Indexing Pipeline Development**

Our team will construct a comprehensive indexing pipeline utilizing your existing extracted and labeled question-answer pairs. This foundation will enable seamless content management and retrieval optimization.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **Advanced Data Processing:** Transform question-answer pairs into optimized chunks with rich metadata structures designed for precision retrieval and personalized questionnaire generation
- **Command-Based Pipeline Architecture:** Develop a scalable, automated system that processes labeled Q&A pairs and efficiently stores them in the vector database with comprehensive metadata indexing
- **Metadata Framework:** Implement sophisticated tagging and categorization systems supporting Key Stage levels, difficulty gradations, and subject-specific filtering

#### **Phase 2: Search API Development**

**Intelligent Query Processing:** Build a powerful API that processes complex queries for topic-specific question retrieval with advanced filtering capabilities.

**API Capabilities:**
- Subject and topic-based question retrieval
- Multi-parameter filtering (Key Stage, difficulty level, question type)
- Scalable query processing for bulk questionnaire generation

#### **Expected Outcomes:**
- **Complete Data Utilization:** Customer will be able to use all labeled data from the model training project for generating questionnaires
- **Future-Ready Architecture:** Customer will own any additional questionnaire indexing using the provided code artifacts for the indexing pipeline
- **Seamless Integration:** Customer will handle integration of the indexing pipeline for automating PDF uploads on their admin console, using developer-provided scripts for extraction, labeling, and indexing
- **Scalable Query Management:** Customer will send requests at the subject topic/question_type level, managing multiple queries for generating comprehensive questionnaires (splitting queries by topic/type when generating many questions)

### 2. AI-Powered Assignment Evaluator Agents

**Objective:** Develop specialized, subject-specific AI agents capable of comprehensive student submission evaluation using customized metric frameworks.

#### **Core Functionality**

**Intelligent Evaluation API:** Our evaluator agents will process and assess student submissions with unprecedented accuracy and consistency.

**API Input Parameters:**
- Subject specification
- Complete questionnaire with answer keys
- Student submission content

**Output Delivery:**
- Comprehensive scoring based on your defined metric framework
- Detailed evaluation insights and feedback generation capabilities

#### **Implementation Approach**

**Subject-Specific Intelligence:** Each evaluator agent will be fine-tuned for specific academic subjects, ensuring contextually accurate assessment aligned with UK educational standards.

**Custom Metric Integration:** Our development team will implement your proprietary metric framework, ensuring evaluations align perfectly with your institutional assessment criteria.

**Seamless Handover:** Complete API development with comprehensive documentation and integration support for smooth deployment within your existing educational technology stack.
