  - Fine-tune GPT-2 for text completion.  

---

#### **Module 4: Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models**  
**Objective:** Adapt models to custom datasets.  
- **Topics:**  
  - Transfer learning in Gen AI.  
  - Data preparation (cleaning, tokenization, chunking).  
  - LoRA, QLoRA, and parameter-efficient tuning.  
- **Lab:**  
  - Fine-tune a Hugging Face model on a custom dataset (e.g., legal docs or medical Q&A).  

---

#### **Module 5: Multimodal AI & RAG Systems**  
**Objective:** Combine text, images, and retrieval for advanced applications.  
- **Topics:**  
  - Introduction to multimodal models (CLIP, Flamingo).  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone).  
- **Lab:**  
  - Build a RAG pipeline using LangChain + OpenAI for document-based Q&A.  
  - Create a meme generator with CLIP + GPT-4.  

---

#### **Module 6: Evaluation, Optimization & Deployment**  
**Objective:** Measure performance and deploy models.  
- **Topics:**  
  - Metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, human evaluation).  
  - Quantization, distillation, and latency reduction.  
  - Deployment via FastAPI, Docker, or cloud (AWS/GCP).  
- **Lab:**  
  - Deploy a fine-tuned model as an API endpoint.  
  - Optimize model inference for speed.  

---

#### **Modules 7–8: Capstone Projects**  
**Objective:** Apply skills to real-world problems.  
- **Guidelines:**  
  - Projects: Code assistant, AI-powered app, enterprise RAG system.  
  - Peer reviews, mentorship, and final presentations.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Multimodal travel planner (text + images).  
  - Domain-specific chatbot with fine-tuning + RAG.
