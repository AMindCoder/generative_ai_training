## Models need tokens to think

**Human:** "Emily buys 3 apples and 2 oranges. Each orange costs $2. The total cost of all the fruit is $13.  
What is the cost of apples?"

**Assistant:** "The answer is $3. This is because 2 oranges at $2 are $4 total.  
So the 3 apples cost $9, and therefore each apple is 9/3 = $3".  
❌

**Assistant:** "The total cost of the oranges is $4. 13 - 4 = 9, the cost of the 3 apples is $9.  
9/3 = 3, so each apple costs $3. The answer is $3".
