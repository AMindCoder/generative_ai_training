## Perplexity

Perplexity is a fundamental metric in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to evaluate language models. It quantifies how well a model predicts a sequence of words, effectively measuring the model's "surprise" or uncertainty when encountering new data. 


Perplexity assesses the confidence of a language model in predicting the next word in a sequence. A lower perplexity indicates that the model is more certain about its predictions, while a higher perplexity suggests greater uncertainty.
