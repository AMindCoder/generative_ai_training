# Proposal for Online Training on RAG: Basics to Advanced

## Overview
We propose a four-day, online training program designed specifically for your corporate team of around 20-30 professionals. The course, “RAG: Basics to Advanced,” is tailored to empower participants with both conceptual knowledge and extensive hands-on experience. Our training approach dedicates 70% of the time to practical exercises and real-world scenarios, supported by 30% theory with insights drawn from latest white papers and industry blogs.

## Training Objectives
- **Foundational Mastery:** Understand the core concepts of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), including its architecture, use cases, and evaluation frameworks.
- **Practical Expertise:** Gain hands-on experience by building applications that leverage RAG methodologies—from QnA systems to sophisticated data indexing and retrieval strategies.
- **Advanced Strategies:** Learn to implement robust solutions for processing and retrieving complex data (text, tabular, and images) using modern tools like pinecone, qdrant vector databases and GPT-4 powered outputs.
- **Real-World Application:** Address industry-specific scenarios that mirror challenges encountered in Financial Market Data like investor communications, annual report analysis, and multimodal data integration.

## Training Structure & Schedule
The course is structured into five modules over four days, with each session not exceeding 4 hours. Training modules are designed in modular manner for you to pick and choose based on your team's needs. 

- **Day 1 (4 Hours Total)**
  - **Module 1: Introduction to RAG (2 Hours)**
    - *Concepts:* Overview of RAG, its use cases, architecture, types, and evaluation frameworks.
    - *Practical:* Develop a QnA application using basic text-based RAG.
  - **Module 2: Embedding Model & Vector DB (2 Hours)**
    - *Concepts:* Fundamentals of tokenization, embedding models, and the architecture/internals of Vector DB.
    - *Practical:* Build an application to store and retrieve company annual report data from a Vector DB.

- **Day 2 (4 Hours Total)**
  - **Module 3: Strategies for Indexing Data (4 Hours)**
    - *Concepts:* Explore diverse chunking strategies (Fixed, Hierarchical, Semantic, Agentic) and selection of embedding models.
    - *Practical Scenarios:*
      - **Scenario 1:** Implement data parsing for multi-page investor meeting transcripts.
      - **Scenario 2:** Index large annual reports (100–200 pages) with integrated tabular data.
      - **Scenario 3:** Apply chunking strategies for documents containing images (charts, graphs, tables).
      - **Scenario 4:** Develop an indexing strategy for extensive annual reports (300–500 pages) incorporating text, tables with table data spanning over multiple pages.

- **Day 3 (4 Hours Total)**
  - **Module 4: Strategies for Data Retrieval (4 Hours)**
    - *Concepts:* Learn about Hybrid Search, embedding models for query generation, multi-query, and re-ranking strategies.
    - *Practical Scenarios:*
      - **Scenario 1:** Create a retrieval system to deduce the Debt-to-Equity ratio from dispersed data points.
      - **Scenario 2:** Build a system to extract key financial metrics (revenue, profit, loss) using Hybrid Search.
      - **Scenario 3:** Enhance retrieval accuracy with re-ranking techniques for less explicit financial metrics (capital spend, future expense, etc.).

- **Day 4 (2–4 Hours Total)**
  - **Module 5: Multimodal RAG (2 Hours)**
    - *Concepts:* Understand the fundamentals and use cases of multimodal RAG and its underlying architecture.
    - *Practical:* Develop a **production grade** QnA application using a multimodal approach.
  - **Additional Q&A / Interactive Session:** (Optional, up to 2 hours) Address participant queries, review key learnings, and discuss real-world applications.

**Complete Training will cost ₹1.7 Lakh (Break up is given in Investment & Value Proposition section)**

## Methodology & Tools
- **Hands-on Focus:** With 70% of the training dedicated to practical exercises, participants will directly engage with real-world scenarios using Jupyter notebooks, ensuring immediate application of learned concepts.
- **Conceptual Depth:** The remaining 30% of the course will cover essential theory, supported by industry-standard white papers and curated blog content.
- **Advanced LLM Integration:** We will leverage the OpenAI GPT-4 model during practical exercises for output generation.
- **Interactive Learning:** Live coding sessions, scenario walkthroughs, collaborative problem-solving exercises and selection of **production infrastructure** will ensure that learning is engaging and directly applicable to corporate challenges.

## Investment & Value Proposition
The comprehensive training package is structured as follows:
- **Module 1 & 2:** Rs. 20K each (4 hours total)
- **Module 3:** Rs. 50K (4 hours, including real use case implementations)
- **Module 4:** Rs. 50K (4 hours, including real use case implementations)
- **Module 5:** Rs. 30K (2 hours, including real use case implementations)
- **Total Investment:** Rs. 170K for 14 hours of targeted, hands-on training.

By investing in this program, your team will gain the technical expertise and practical insights needed to implement RAG solutions that drive real business value.

## Conclusion & Next Steps
This training is designed to transform theoretical knowledge into actionable skills, ensuring that your corporate team is well-equipped to design, develop, and deploy RAG-based applications effectively. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and drive innovation within your organization.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Review & Feedback:** We welcome any questions or adjustments to the proposed training structure.
2. **Schedule Confirmation:** Upon agreement, we will finalize the training schedule and logistics.
3. **Training Materials:** All notebooks will be shared post training.

## Post Training Support
To ensure that your team continues to benefit from the training, we offer dedicated post-training support for 14 days (Free of cost) following the completion of the course. During this period:
- **Query Resolution:** We will be available to answer any questions related to the training material.
- **Flexible Meetings:** Support can be provided through scheduled meetings or offline interactions based on your team's needs.
- **Material Clarification:** Further explanations and walkthroughs of the Jupyter notebooks and reference materials can be arranged.

We are committed to ensuring that your team fully leverages the training insights for real-world success.
