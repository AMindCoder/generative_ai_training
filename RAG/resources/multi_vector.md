Single-vector embeddings are so 2022.

There's a quiet revolution happening within multi-vector models, and you'll never look back.

Typical vector search works with single vectors - a piece of text like "A very nice cat" gets converted into one long array of numbers like [0.041, 0.106, 0.502, ...]

But what if we could represent each word or token with its own vector? That's exactly what multi-vector models like ColBERT, ColPali, and ColQwen do.

Instead of smashing all semantic meaning into one vector, these models create a 𝘴𝘦𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘷𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘴 for each document or query. This approach enables something magical called "late interaction."

So what's late interaction?

Traditional embedding models force an early decision about similarity - they compute a single vector and then measure distance between these points.

Multi-vector models, however, keep individual token representations separate and compute similarity between specific parts of the text. It's like comparing documents word-by-word rather than as a whole.

The benefits are substantial:
• More precise matching between queries and documents
• Better preservation of token-level semantics
• Improved retrieval of similar objects
• Higher accuracy for complex queries

Let's break down the main multi-vector models:

𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗕𝗘𝗥𝗧 - The pioneer in this space. Keeps track of every token and uses a "MaxSim" operation to find the best matches between query and document tokens. Available in v1 and v2 versions, with v2 being more efficient.

𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗣𝗮𝗹𝗶 - A multimodal extension that applies the same principles to cross-modal retrieval, allowing for more nuanced matching between different types of content.

𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗤𝘄𝗲𝗻 - A newer implementation built on Qwen architecture, bringing the power of multi-vector representations to this model family.

So when should you use multi-vector models instead of regular embeddings?

1. When precision matters more than speed
2. For complex semantic matching tasks
3. When you need to capture fine-grained relationships
4. For specialized domain searches where context is critical

The tradeoff? Multi-vector approaches do require more storage space, as you're keeping multiple vectors per document. They also involve more computation during similarity calculation.

But as hardware improves and implementations get more efficient (like ColBERTv2 which dramatically reduces the space footprint), these models are becoming increasingly practical for production systems
